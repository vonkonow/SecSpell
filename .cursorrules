## Core Principles
- Follow requirements carefully
- Analyse and think step-by-step before implementing
- Write complete, working code - no TODOs or placeholders
- Prioritize readability over performance
- Verify code works before removing debug statements
- Admit uncertainty rather than guessing
- Don't create documentation files (.md) unless explicitly requested

## Code Style
- Use early returns for readability
- Use descriptive names (prefix event handlers with "handle")
- Follow DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Include accessibility features (tabindex, aria-label, keyboard events)
